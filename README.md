### ‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Examples
This repository includes examples for the following core tools of Groclake:
- **Vectorlake**
- **Modellake**
- **Datalake**

These tools are essential for building **RAG-based chatbots** with advanced agentic capabilities. Additionally, the repository provides **three sample RAG-based chatbot implementations** to demonstrate practical use cases.

Groclake is available as a Python library. You can install it using:
```bash
pip install groclake
```

#### Workflow Overview
1. Use **Vectorlake**, **Modellake**, and **Datalake** to build a chatbot.
2. Create a frontend using any programming language.
3. Connect the frontend to the chatbot by creating API endpoints.

**Note**: For hackathons, you don‚Äôt need to host the chatbot; running it locally is sufficient.
